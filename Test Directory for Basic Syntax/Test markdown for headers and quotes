This is normal text. Notion has provisions only for H1-H3.

Below are alternative ways to render headers

Heading level 1
===============

Heading level 2
---------------

Paragraphs are created using a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

To create a line break or new line (<br>),   
end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

**add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase to make them bold.**

To bolden the middle of a word, add two astericks before and after the letters you would like to affect. Like this: Love**is**bold

To italizise text: Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
To use bold and italics at the same time, use: This text is ***really important***. or;   
This text is ___really important___. or;   
This text is __*really important*__. or;   
This text is **_really important_**. or;   
This is really***very***important text.
